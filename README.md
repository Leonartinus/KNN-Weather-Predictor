# KNN-Weather-Predictor
## Description

The project provide a model can predict weather hourly at YVR.
I use KNN algorithms to train the model using the hourly climate dataset download from the government of Canada official website https://climate.weather.gc.ca/historical_data/search_historic_data_stations_e.html?searchType=stnName&timeframe=1&txtStationName=VANCOUVER+INTL+A&searchMethod=contains&optLimit=yearRange&StartYear=1840&EndYear=2024&Year=2024&Month=3&Day=3&selRowPerPage=25

Given current climate data and the current weather to predict the weather in the next hour.

Model has a remarable accuracy 99.8%
